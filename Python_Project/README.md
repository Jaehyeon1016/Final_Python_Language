# Jaehyeon Park Python Project

In this project, I will display the graph and table that shows the COVID-19 confirmed cases in South Korea
and I will analyze the graph and compare them to see the correlation between them.

I draw bar, line, and area graph to show the trend of the data.

I calculated mean, max, min, median, and skewness of the data to analyze the data.
